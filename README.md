# [Awesome Linux GUI](https://com3dian.github.io/awesome-linux-gui/)

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

For many years, Linux GUI users struggled to find software that was both modern, easy to use, and powerfulâ€”unlike users of other operating systems. However, things have changed: in recent years, many great apps designed for or available on Linux have emerged. This repo aims to provide a curated list of awesome Linux GUI applications, inspired by the [awesome-mac](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac?tab=readme-ov-file#ebooks) project.
